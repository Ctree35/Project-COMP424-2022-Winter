## Setup

To setup the game, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Playing a game

To start playing a game, we need to implement [_agents_](agents/agent.py). For example, to play the game using two random agents (agents which take a random action), run the following:

```bash
python simulator.py --player_1 random_agent --player_2 random_agent
```

This will spawn a random game board of size NxN, and run the two agents of class [RandomAgent](agents/random_agent.py). You will be able to see their moves in the console.

## Visualizing a game

To visualize the moves within a game, use the `--display` flag. You can set the delay (in seconds) using `--display_delay` argument to better visualize the steps the agents take to win a game.

```bash
python simulator.py --player_1 random_agent --player_2 random_agent --display
```

## Play on your own!

To play the game on your own, use a [`human_agent`](agents/human_agent.py) to play the game.

```bash
python simulator.py --player_1 human_agent --player_2 random_agent --display
```

## Autoplaying multiple games

Since boards are drawn randomly (between a [`MIN_BOARD_SIZE`](world.py#L17) and [`MAX_BOARD_SIZE`](world.py#L18)) you can compute an aggregate win % over your agents. Use the `--autoplay` flag to run $n$ games sequentially, where $n$ can be set using `--autoplay_runs`.

```bash
python simulator.py --player_1 random_agent --player_2 random_agent --autoplay
```

During autoplay, boards are drawn randomly between size `--board_size_min` and `--board_size_max` for each iteration.

**Notes**

- Not all agents supports autoplay. The variable `self.autoplay` in [Agent](agents/agent.py) can be set to `True` to allow the agent to be autoplayed. Typically this flag is set to false for a `human_agent`.
- UI display will be disabled in an autoplay.

## Write your own agent

You need to write your own agent and submit it for the class project. To do so: 

1. Modify the [`student_agent.py`](agents/student_agent.py) file in [`agents/`](agents/) directory, which extends the [`agents.Agent`](agents/agent.py) class. 
2. Implement the `step` function with your game logic
3. Register your agent using the decorator [`register_agent`](agents/random_agent.py#L7). The `StudentAgent` class is already decorated with `student_agent` name, feel free to change it or keep it the same.
4. [This step is already done for `StudentAgent`] Import your agent in the [`__init__.py`](agents/__init__.py) file in [`agents/`](agents/) directory
5. Run and test your agent using the information above

    ```
    python simulator.py --player_1 random_agent --player_2 student_agent --display 
    ```

6. Check autoplay with your agent and `random_agent` is working

    ```
    python simulator.py --player_1 random_agent --player_2 student_agent --autoplay
    ```

## Full API

```bash
python simulator.py -h       
usage: simulator.py [-h] [--player_1 PLAYER_1] [--player_2 PLAYER_2]
                    [--board_size BOARD_SIZE] [--display]
                    [--display_delay DISPLAY_DELAY]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --player_1 PLAYER_1
  --player_2 PLAYER_2
  --board_size BOARD_SIZE
  --display
  --display_delay DISPLAY_DELAY
  --autoplay
  --autoplay_runs AUTOPLAY_RUNS
```


## Game Rules

### Game Setting
On an *M* x *M* chess board, 2 players are randomly distributed on the board with one player occupying one block.

### Game Moving
In each turn, one player moves at most `K` steps (between `0` and `K`), where each step can be in either horizontal or vertical direction, and must put a barrier around him or her in one of the 4 directions except the boarders of the chess board. The players move in a round-robin way.

#### Note: 
 - Each player cannot go into other player's place or put barriers in areas that already have barriers.
 - Currently the maximal number of steps is set to `K = (M + 1) // 2`.

### Game Ending
The game ends when each player is separated in a closed zone by the barriers and boundaries. The final score for each player will be the number of blocks in that zone.
```math
S_i = \#\text{Blocks of Zone}_i
```

### Goal
Each player should maximize the final score of itself, i.e., the number of blocks in its zone in the endgame.

### Example Gameplay
Here we show a gameplay describing a $`2`$-player game on a $`5\times 5`$ chessboard. Each player can move at most $`3`$ steps in each round.

The final score is $`A:B = 15:10`$. So A wins the game.
